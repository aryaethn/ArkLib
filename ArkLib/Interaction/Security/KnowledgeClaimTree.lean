/-! ## Knowledge claim tree

A `KnowledgeClaimTree` augments `ClaimTree` with a backward `extractMid`
function at each node. This enables round-by-round *knowledge* soundness:
- At sender nodes, if the child claim is good, extracting back yields a good
  parent claim (backward condition).
- At receiver nodes, a bad parent claim leads to a good child claim with
  probability at most `error` (forward probabilistic bound).
-/

a `Spec` with a knowledge-soundness witness. -/

/-! ## Round-by-round knowledge soundness

Round-by-round knowledge soundness existentially quantifies over a
`KnowledgeClaimTree` with per-round error bounds and boundary conditions
connecting the claim tree to `relIn` and `relOut`. -/

namespace Verifier

/-- **Round-by-round knowledge soundness**: there exists a knowledge claim tree
such that:
1. The tree satisfies `IsKnowledgeSound` per-round.
2. The worst-case cumulative error is at most `ε shared stmt`.
3. Root boundary: good root claim is equivalent to the extracted witness being
   in `relIn`.
4. Forward terminal boundary: valid output in `relOut` implies the root claim's
   forward path reaches a good terminal (for soundness via `maxPathError`).
5. Backward terminal boundary: valid output maps to a good terminal claim
   via `terminalOf` (for transcript-dependent knowledge extraction via
   `extractBack`). -/
