# Toy problem soundness bounds (ABF26 §6)

Statement-layer for the §6 soundness bounds that do **not** depend on a
formal protocol object. The three protocol-level soundness lemmas
(`L6.6`, `L6.8`, `L6.10`) live alongside the protocol definitions in
`ToyProblem/Spec/General.lean` (C6.2) and
`ToyProblem/Spec/SimplifiedIOR.lean` (C6.9).

Items in this file:

* `ToyProblem.additive_code_supports_erasure_correction_grs12`
   — Lemma 6.5 [GRS12]: every additive code supports erasure correction
   with correction time `O((s · n)^3)`.

* `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_listDecoding_lb`
   — Lemma 6.12 [ABF26]: list-decoding-based lower bound on the
   soundness error of the simplified IOR `T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9).
   Uses Claim B.1 via `Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`.

* `ToyProblem.simplified_iop_soundness_ca_lb`
   — Lemma 6.13 [ABF26]: correlated-agreement-based lower bound on the
   soundness error of `T'[C, t]`.

All three are admitted as tagged sorries: L6.5 is a paper-cited
classical result; L6.12 and L6.13 are stated in coding-theory form
(direct cardinality bounds on `winningSet`) — their protocol-level
reading bounds the soundness of `ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.reduction`
from below.

Every `F`-additive code `C : F^k → (F^s)^n` supports erasure correction
(in the sense of `SupportsErasureCorrection`) with correction time
`O((s · n)^3)`. Equivalently: the predicate
`SupportsErasureCorrection C ecor` holds for some
`ecor ≤ K · (s · n)^3`. We state the more permissive
"some `ecor` works" form here; pinning down the constant `K` requires
modelling the encoder concretely.

/-- **Lemma 6.12 of [ABF26]** (list-decoding lower bound on the simplified IOR).

Coding-theory form: if `|F| > binomial(|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)|, 2)`, then there
exist witnesses `(v, μ_1, μ_2, f_1, f_2)` with `(f_1, f_2)` lying outside
the relaxed relation `R̃_{C,δ}^2`, for which the winning challenge set
`Ω^{f_1,f_2}_{v,μ_1,μ_2}` (Definition 6.11) has at least
`|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| · |F| / (|F| + |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| - 1)` elements.

The protocol-level reading: the soundness error of the simplified IOR
`T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9, `ToyProblem.SimplifiedIOR.reduction`) is
at least `|Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| / (|F| + |Λ(C^{≡2}, δ)| - 1)`.

The proof uses Claim B.1 of the paper (collision bound for random
functions; available in ArkLib as
`Probability.exists_large_image_of_pairwise_collision_bound`) to find a
`v ∈ F^k` along which many of the colliding-pair images of the
list-decoding "list" are distinct, then converts this to a winning
challenge set of large cardinality.

/-- **Lemma 6.13 of [ABF26]** (correlated-agreement lower bound on the simplified IOR).

Coding-theory form: there exist `(v, μ_1, μ_2, f_1, f_2)` with
`(f_1, f_2)` outside the relaxed relation `R̃_{C,δ}^2` whose winning
challenge set has size at least `ε_ca(C, δ) · |F|`.

Protocol-level reading: the soundness error of the simplified IOR
`T'[C, t]` (Construction 6.9) is at least `ε_ca(C, δ)`.

Proof sketch: take `f_1, f_2` maximising the CA error; then
`f_1 + γ·f_2` is `δ`-close to `C` precisely on a set `S` of size
`ε_ca · |F|`, and `S` is contained in the winning set
`Ω^{f_1,f_2}_{0^k, 0, 0}` of Definition 6.11.

Admitted as an external result (proved in ABF26 §6.4.2). The bound is in
terms of `ε_ca` (correlated agreement) rather than `ε_mca` (mutual
correlated agreement); the latter would be qualitatively stronger but no
attack reaching `ε_mca > ε_ca` is currently known (Remark 6.14). -/
