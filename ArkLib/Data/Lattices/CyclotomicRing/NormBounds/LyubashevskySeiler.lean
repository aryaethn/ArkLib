# Lyubashevsky–Seiler: Short Elements Are Invertible

The Lyubashevsky–Seiler invertibility result [LS18, Corollary 1.2]; recalled as Lemma 3 of
the Hachi paper [NOZ26]: over the power-of-two cyclotomic modulus `φ = X^{2^α} + 1`
(`powTwoCyclotomic α`) with a prime `q ≡ 5 (mod 8)`, a nonzero element of
`Rq (powTwoCyclotomic α) = ZMod q[X]/(X^{2^α}+1)` whose centered Euclidean norm is below
`√q` is a unit.

The statement is deliberately pinned to `powTwoCyclotomic α` (`X^{2^α}+1`): LS18 Cor. 1.2
is the `k = 2` splitting case (`q ≡ 2·2+1 ≡ 5 (mod 8)`, Euclidean bound `q^{1/2} = √q`),
and that splitting / minimum-distance analysis is specific to the negacyclic ring. For a
general cyclotomic `Φ_m` of power-of-two *degree* (e.g. `Φ₁₅`, `Φ₁₂`) the `q ≡ 5 (mod 8)`
condition and the `√q` bound are simply wrong, so phrasing the lemma for an arbitrary
`Φ` with `deg φ = 2^α` would be unsound.

This is one of the two unproven lemmas for the Greyhound [NS24] / Hachi [NOZ26]
weak-binding argument. The proof is a genuine piece of algebraic number theory
(factorization of `X^{2^α}+1 mod q` into two factors, the maximal ideals realized as ideal
lattices of determinant `q^{2^{α-1}}`, and a minimum-distance lower bound via the cyclotomic
embedding). None of this is available in Mathlib in directly usable form, so the result is
deferred (`sorry`) for now.
