/-! ## Round-by-round soundness via claim trees

Round-by-round soundness existentially quantifies over a `ClaimTree` (the state
function) with per-round error bounds. This matches core ArkLib's
`Verifier.StateFunction`-based definition, where the `ClaimTree` serves as the
structural equivalent:
- `ClaimTree.good` = state function predicate at each round
- `.sender` nodes: bad claims stay bad (= `toFun_next`)
- `.receiver` nodes: per-round error bound (= per-challenge error)
- `ClaimTree.maxPathError` = worst-case total error -/

/-- **Round-by-round soundness**: there exists a claim tree (state function)
such that:
1. The tree is sound per-round (`IsSound`): bad claims stay bad at sender nodes,
   and flip to good with probability at most `error` at receiver nodes.
2. The root claim is bad for all invalid statements.
3. The worst-case cumulative error is at most `ε`.
4. Membership in the output language implies terminal goodness (bridges the tree
   to the verifier). -/
