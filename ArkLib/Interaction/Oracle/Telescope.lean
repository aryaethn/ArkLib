# Platonic chain primitive (`Oracle.Spec.Telescope`)

`Telescope round step` is the *initial algebra* of the segment functor that
extends an oracle protocol by one round whose spec depends on the current
state and then transitions to a new state determined by the round's
**public** transcript. This is the `Oracle.Spec` analogue of VCVio's
`Interaction.Spec.Telescope`, with the key adjustment that state transitions
are indexed by `PublicTranscript` rather than the full `Transcript`:
oracle-message values are not observable to the verifier and therefore
cannot influence the *shape* of subsequent rounds. State *contents* may
still depend on private prover data; that information is layered on top of
the bare telescope shape.

Given
* a state space `St : Type v`,
* a round assignment `round : St → Oracle.Spec`,
* a state transition `step : (s : St) → PublicTranscript (round s) → St`,

an inhabitant of `Telescope round step s₀` is a finite tree of `extend`
steps ending in `done`. The construction is well-founded by virtue of being
an inductive: there is no way to construct an infinite-depth instance, so
inhabitation is itself a constructive termination proof for the underlying
state machine.

## Universal property

`Telescope round step` is the carrier of the initial `(round, step)`-algebra
in the slice category over `St`: for any other `(round, step)`-algebra
`(P : St → Type _, alg)`, there is a unique structure-preserving map
`Telescope round step → P` given by structural recursion on the inductive.
`toSpec` is one such recursion, with target algebra
`(fun _ => Oracle.Spec, .done, fun s cont => (round s).append cont)`.

## Relationship to `Oracle.Spec.Chain`

`Spec.Chain n` (in `ArkLib/Interaction/Oracle/Chain.lean`) is the
specialisation `St := Nat`, with `step` ignoring the public transcript and
decrementing the depth, and decorations (`RoleDeco` / `OracleDeco`) baked
into the carrier at every level. Telescope is the underlying shape; chains
and similar constructions are decorated views of it.

/-- Initial-algebra presentation of a state-machine telescope of
`Oracle.Spec`s.

At each state `s : St`, an inhabitant either terminates (`.done s`) or
extends by running the round `round s : Oracle.Spec` and recursing into
`Telescope round step (step s pt)` for every public transcript
`pt : PublicTranscript (round s)`. As an inductive type, every inhabitant
is finite, so the existence of a `Telescope` term is a proof that the
underlying state machine terminates. -/
