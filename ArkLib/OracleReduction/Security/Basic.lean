  # Security Definitions for (Oracle) Reductions

  This file defines basic security notions for (oracle) reductions:

  - (Perfect) Completeness

  - (Straightline) (Knowledge) Soundness

  - (Honest-verifier) Zero-knowledge

  For each security notion, we provide a typeclass for it, so that security can be synthesized
  automatically with verified transformations.

  See other files in the same directory for more refined soundness notions (i.e. state-restoration,
  round-by-round, rewinding, etc.)

TODO: the "right" factoring for the security definitions are the following:

- We have a two-layer interpretation approach: first, interpret the oracle queries into some monad
  `m` which admits a monad morphism into `PMF` (i.e. `HasEvalDist`); then we interpret the resulting
  monad into `PMF`.

  This does not preclude `m` from being the same oracle computation type, but more interesting
  possibilities are possible, such as `m = ReaderT ρ` for lazy sampling of the shared oracle.

  Another possibility: given `OracleInterface OStmt`, we have an interpretation map

  `interpOStmt : OracleComp (oSpec + [OStmt]ₒ) →ᵐ ReaderT OStmt (OracleComp oSpec)`

- Relations should be `Stmt → Wit → m Prop`, with `m` being the intermediate monad. When `m` is the
  result of `interpOStmt` above, for instance, we get `Stmt → Wit → OStmt → Prop`, which is what we
  want. Same for when we interpret `oSpec` into `Reader (QueryImpl oSpec Id)`; we then have
  `Stmt → Wit → QueryImpl oSpec Id → Prop`, which allows us to define relations that rely
  on the (randomly sampled, at the beginning) values of the shared oracle.

section Completeness


/-- A reduction satisfies **completeness** with regards to:
  - an initialization function `init : ProbComp σ` for some ambient state `σ`,
  - a stateful query implementation `impl` (in terms of `StateT σ ProbComp`)
  for the shared oracles `oSpec`,
  - an input relation `relIn` and output relation `relOut` (represented as sets), and
  - an error `completenessError ≥ 0`,

  if for all valid statement-witness pair `(stmtIn, witIn) ∈ relIn`, the execution between the
  honest prover and the honest verifier will result in a tuple `((prvStmtOut, witOut), stmtOut)`
  such that

  - `(stmtOut, witOut) ∈ relOut`, (the output statement-witness pair is valid) and
  - `prvStmtOut = stmtOut`, (the output statements are the same from both prover and verifier)

  except with probability `completenessError`.

section Soundness

/-! We define 3 variants each of soundness and knowledge soundness:

  1. (Plain) soundness
  2. Knowledge soundness

  For adaptivity, we may want to seed the definition with a term
    `chooseStmtIn : OracleComp oSpec StmtIn`
  (though this is essentially the same as quantifying over all `stmtIn : StmtIn`).

  Note: all soundness definitions are really defined for the **verifier** only. The (honest)
prover does not feature into the definitions.
-/

namespace Extractor

/- We define different types of extractors here -/

variable (oSpec : OracleSpec ι) (StmtIn WitIn WitOut : Type) {n : ℕ} (pSpec : ProtocolSpec n)

/-- A straightline, deterministic, non-oracle-querying extractor takes in the output witness, the
  initial statement, the IOR transcript, and the query logs from the prover and verifier, and
  returns a corresponding initial witness.

  Note that the extractor does not need to take in the output statement, since it can be derived
  via re-running the verifier on the initial statement, the transcript, and the verifier's query
  log.

  This form of extractor suffices for proving knowledge soundness of most hash-based IOPs.
-/
def Straightline :=
  StmtIn → -- input statement
  WitOut → -- output witness
  FullTranscript pSpec → -- reduction transcript
  QueryLog oSpec → -- prover's query log
  QueryLog oSpec → -- verifier's query log
  OptionT (OracleComp oSpec) WitIn -- input witness

end Extractor

namespace Verifier

/-- A reduction satisfies **soundness** with error `soundnessError ≥ 0` and with respect to input
  language `langIn : Set StmtIn` and output language `langOut : Set StmtOut` if:
  - for all (malicious) provers with arbitrary types for `WitIn`, `WitOut`,
  - for all arbitrary `witIn`,
  - for all input statement `stmtIn ∉ langIn`,

  the execution between the prover and the honest verifier will result in an output statement
  `stmtOut` that is in `langOut` is at most `soundnessError`.

  (technical note: since execution may fail, this is _not_ equivalent to saying that
  `stmtOut ∉ langOut` with probability at least `1 - soundnessError`)

-- functions (receive challenges and send messages), and be able to observe & simulate the prover's

#check Reduction.runWithLog
/-- A reduction satisfies **(straightline) knowledge soundness** with error `knowledgeError ≥ 0` and
  with respect to input relation `relIn` and output relation `relOut` if:
  - there exists a straightline extractor `E`, such that
  - for all input statement `stmtIn`, witness `witIn`, and (malicious) prover `prover`,
  - if the execution with the honest verifier results in a pair `(stmtOut, witOut)`,

  then the probability that `(stmtOut, witOut)` is valid and yet the extractor fails to produce
  a witness `witIn'` such that `(stmtIn, witIn')` is valid is at most `knowledgeError`.

  Implementation note: the extractor returns an `OptionT` computation, so it may fail. We run
  this `OptionT` layer explicitly (via `.run`) and keep the resulting `Option WitIn` in the
  game's output, so that extractor failure counts as a "bad" event (the adversary wins).

  This is essential for the definition to be meaningful: if instead the extractor were bound
  inside the surrounding `OptionT` computation, its failure would contribute to the failure
  mass of the whole game, which `probEvent` excludes (it only measures `some` outputs). The
  always-failing extractor `fun _ _ _ _ _ => failure` would then drive the game's event
  probability to `0`, vacuously discharging knowledge soundness (at error `0`!) for any
  verifier and any relations.

  In contrast, failures of the reduction execution itself (e.g. the verifier aborting) are
  still excluded from the event, matching the convention for (plain) soundness: a run in which
  the verifier does not accept imposes no obligation on the extractor.

/-! ## Adaptive, query-bounded security (generic)

`Verifier.soundness` / `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness` above are *selective* (the input statement is
fixed upfront, `∀ stmtIn ∉ langIn`) and *unbounded* (a single error bounds **every** prover).  Some
schemes — notably non-interactive arguments in the ideal-permutation model (CO25 §6) — instead need:

- **Adaptive** soundness: the (malicious) prover *outputs* its statement, and the break event is
  read off that output (`stmt ∉ langIn ∧ accept`), rather than the statement being chosen for it.
- **Query-bounded** error: the error legitimately depends on the prover's query budget (e.g. the
  Key-Lemma `η★` term grows with the number of permutation/hash queries), so the quantifier must be
  restricted to provers meeting a budget predicate — a single error for *all* provers is impossible.

The two scheme-agnostic definitions below capture exactly this generalization.  They abstract:
- a prover type `P` and a game `game : P → ProbComp O` whose output `O` encodes the prover-chosen
  statement and the verifier's accept bit;
- the soundness-break / extraction-failure event `evt : O → Prop`;
- a query-budget predicate `bound : P → Prop`;
- the error `error`.

Taking `bound := fun _ => True` recovers an unbounded form; writing `evt` to *read* the
prover-chosen statement off the output (instead of receiving it upfront) is what makes it adaptive.
DSFS instantiates these directly in `…/DuplexSponge/Security/Soundness.lean` (the conclusions of
`theorem_6_1_soundness` / `theorem_6_2_straightline`). -/
section AdaptiveBounded

/-- **Adaptive, query-bounded soundness** (generic, scheme-agnostic): every prover `p` meeting the
query budget `bound` makes the soundness-break event `evt` happen with probability at most `error`
in its game `game p`. -/

most `error`. -/

end AdaptiveBounded

/-! ### Concrete non-interactive (NARG) experiments — CO25 Def 3.5 / Def 3.6

The two combinators above leave the *experiment* (`game`) abstract.  CO25 Defs 3.5/3.6 instead spell
the experiment out: sample the oracle, run the (adaptive) malicious prover for `(x, π)`, run the
verifier, and read the predicate off the sampled tuple.  The definitions below encode exactly that
experiment for a **non-interactive argument in an oracle model**, then phrase soundness / knowledge
soundness as the corresponding `adaptiveSoundnessBounded` / `adaptiveKnowledgeSoundnessBounded`
instances.  So the experiment lives here in the library, not at the call site.

**Oracle access (`P̃^f`, `V^f`).** `oSpec` here is *the random-oracle interface itself* — the FS
challenge / duplex-sponge oracle — **not** a static side-oracle.  The paper's `f ← 𝒟(λ,n)` is the
handler pair `(init, impl)`: `init` *draws* the oracle instance `f ~ 𝒟` into state `σ`, and `impl`
answers **every `oSpec` query — of both the prover `P` and the verifier `verify` — against that one
draw**, since both run inside a single `simulateQ impl (do P; verify)`.  So `P` and `V` share oracle
access to the same sampled `f`, exactly as `P̃^f` and `V^f`.  (This is the standard codebase handler
convention: cf. `Verifier.soundness`'s `impl.addLift challengeQueryImpl`, the SR experiments, and
DSFS's `hyb0Init`/`hyb0Impl` which sample-and-answer `(h,p,p⁻¹)`.)  When the prover's oracle
interface is strictly larger than the verifier's (e.g. DSFS: the prover has `p⁻¹` but the verifier
does not), take `oSpec` to be the *prover's* spec and pass `verify` as a computation lifted into it.

Other modeling choices (and how they map to the paper):
- The paper's decision bit `V^f(x,π)=1` is generalized to "the verifier produces some `stmtOut ∈
  langOut`" (recovering the Boolean case with `langOut = {true}`); `verify` is the compiled
  non-interactive verifier `V^f(x,·)` as an `OptionT` computation (it may reject = `none`).
- The malicious prover is the **flat, adaptive** `OracleComp oSpec (StmtIn × Proof)` — it *outputs*
  `x`, matching `(x,π) ← P̃^f`.  `bound` is the `t`-query budget predicate.
- For knowledge soundness (Def 3.6) the experiment additionally captures the prover's query log `tr`
  (via `loggingOracle`) and feeds `(x, π, tr)` to the extractor, matching `w ← E(x,π,tr)`. -/
section AdaptiveNARG

/-- **CO25 Def 3.5 experiment** — the adaptive NARG soundness game in an oracle model: sample the

the extracted witness misses `relIn` (or no witness is produced) — with probability at most `error`.
(Acceptance is implicit in the game returning `some`, matching CO25 Def 3.6's `V^f(x,π)=1`; no
output language is needed.) -/

/-! ### Coin-bearing NARG experiments (compiled / randomized provers)

CO25 §6 reduces a NARG to its interactive proof via a *compiled* prover that samples its own private
randomness (DSFS's `D2SAlgo^f(P̃)` does lookahead/backtrack sampling).  Such a prover is not
coin-free, so the soundness/KS experiment must answer its coins.  Mirroring the SR layer's
`SoundnessWithCoins` / `coinSRExperimentProb`, the prover here queries `oSpec + auxSpec` (the random
oracle interface `oSpec` plus private coins `auxSpec`); `impl` serves `oSpec` against the
`init`-draw, `auxImpl` serves the coins at game time, and the verifier/extractor live over base
`oSpec`
(coin-blind), lifted into the game spec.  Taking `auxSpec := []ₒ` recovers the coin-free experiments
up to `+ []ₒ`. -/

/-! ### Verifier-facing adaptive-NARG (K)soundness (CO25 Def 3.5/3.6)

The `adaptiveNARG*` defs above take a bare `verify : StmtIn → Proof → OptionT (OracleComp oSpec)
StmtOut` function (the reusable, fully-general machinery).  The `Verifier.*` methods below package
them as security notions **of a `NonInteractiveVerifier`** — the verifier whose single P→V message
is the proof `π`, with `verify x π := verifier.verify x ⟨π⟩` reading `π` off the length-1 transcript
(`Fin.cons π …`).  This mirrors `Verifier.soundness` / `Verifier.knowledgeSoundness`, and
lets call sites pass the real compiled NARG verifier (e.g. `Verifier.singleSaltFiatShamir V`).

These are the right notions only for the **non-interactive** regime: the flat prover outputs the
whole proof, and any challenges are derived inside `verify` from `oSpec` (FS), not chosen by the
prover.  For interactive verifiers the framework already provides `Verifier.soundness`
(round-by-round) and `Verifier.StateRestoration.soundness` (prover controls challenges via SR). -/
